	<p>*Question#4: I found another site that is somewhat related. It shows the possible disguises that these killer gnomes might appear as. I think it's a pretty good looking website and very detailed. The top section stays whether you scroll up & down. Lots of different styles of font and block styles. I recognize some of the elements but it's not the simple layout we are used to at this stage. One that I don't recognize is link rel="stylesheet". I can assume it goes to a link that has all the styles that were used to format the text. Click <a class="link" href="http://hiconsumption.com/2013/06/7-badass-garden-gnomes-to-protect-your-front-lawn/">here</a> to view the other site.</p>
